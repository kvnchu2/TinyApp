# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node, Express, and MongoDB that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

*Note - This application was built for coding bootcamp, but after bootcamp I came back to revitalize this app. 

1. Previously, the database was hardcoded, but I was able to replace it with mongoDB. 
2. I added in error handling for the login and registration pages

The app is deployed and you can visit it at this link: http://tiny-app-url.herokuapp.com/
